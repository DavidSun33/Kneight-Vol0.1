# Kneight-Vol0.1
Where I put my Kneight.py Game. 

Kneight is a game I have self-developed, because, well, I like challenges. 

So far, this is all I have, and it is all in folders. 

This will be updated when I update code sucessfully. 

I made all the art, and the code only borrows some basic knowledge such as pygame.init from other repositaries I have. 

Please use this in your game-creating experience. It is very free. If you were creating games and did not know how to fix the problem of arrow-key walking, here's some help.

Thanks to Github, Stack Overflow, Jupyter Notebook, and Scratch. 

Thanks to Github for letting me share my code here. 

Thanks to Stack Overflow for giving me tips from other users when I needed it. 

Thanks to Jupyter Notebook so I could code on the platform. 

Thanks to Scratch for inviting me to code games. 

Thanks to life for creating me. 

I still exist.

To download files, go to the repositary and click "code". Then press "Download ZIP", and it will be saved. Then, right-click your file on the bottom of your screen and press "Show in Folder". It will show the location. Rename or move it if you want. 

If you have any problems running the code, please contact me on github.
